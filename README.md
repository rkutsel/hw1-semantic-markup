# hw1-semantic-markup HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## [Link to the website](https://rkutsel.github.io/hw1-semantic-markup/)

## The list of completed tasks: 

* Refactored the layout of **```index.html```** by replacing ` <div>s` with more semantically-compliant **HTML5** tags.
* Reflected those changes in **```style.css```** accordingly. 
* **```index.html```** had a stale copyright date. Updated the year to 2022. 
* Resized **```.jpeg```** images to improve load time. 

Refactoring did not affect the design and the look of the main page.
